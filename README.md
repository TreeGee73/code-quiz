## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a quiz that utilizes JavaScript to manage what is displayed by interfacing with the DOM rather than making changes to the HTML. This is a good way to avoid "repeating yourself" when creating a dynamic page. This method listens for events like mouse clicks and responds to the events, as well as allows for the creation of elements, manipulation of elements (changing attributes, adding content, etc.), and creating a locally stored record of data based on form input.
